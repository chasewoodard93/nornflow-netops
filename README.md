> ***NornFlow is still in beta phase.***

NornFlow is a lightweight workflow orchestration framework built on top of [Nornir](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir), bringing structure and predictability to network automation projects.

## What is NornFlow?

NornFlow bridges the gap between development and operations teams by providing:

- A **structured workflow system** for organizing Nornir tasks into reusable automation flows
- A **declarative YAML interface** for defining complex automation sequences
- A **command-line interface** for running individual tasks or complete workflows
- A **variable system** with multi-level precedence for flexible customization

## Why Use NornFlow?

NornFlow promotes collaboration between developers and network engineers:

üí™ **Developer-friendly**: Write automation logic as pure Python functions with Nornir's task interface. No boilerplate, no plugins, just clean Python code.

üëç **Operations-friendly**: Define and run workflows with familiar YAML syntax similar to Ansible playbooks, enabling team members to be productive regardless of their Python programming background.

üîß **Team-friendly**: Even when the same team handles both development and operations, NornFlow provides a clean separation of concerns:
- Developers focus on task implementation details
- Operators focus on workflow logic and task sequencing

üß© **Project-friendly**: Brings predictable structure to Nornir projects with:
- Standardized directory organization
- Consistent workflow definition patterns
- Clear separation between tasks, workflows, and inventory
