# This file is a sample of NornFlow settings. Modify it as needed to fit your project's requirements.
# You can create your own '<something>.yaml' file in the root of your project. NornFlow will look for a settings YAML file in the following order:
# 1. The path specified in the environment variable 'NORNFLOW_SETTINGS'
# 2. The path passed to NornFlowSettings initializer (using the 'nornflow run --settings' argument)
# 3. The path 'nornflow.yaml' in the root of the project

# Path for Nornir's config file

# List of paths to directories containing the Nornir tasks to be included in NornFlow's task catalog.
# Defaults to a 'tasks' directory in the root of the project.
# The search is recursive, so all subdirectories will be searched as well.

# List of Python packages installed in your environment that contain Nornir tasks to be included in NornFlow's task catalog.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# The above settings can only be set through a NorFlow YAML settings file, whether mandatory or optional.
# The following settings are still optional and can be set either through a NorFlow YAML settings file or CLI arguments.
# CLI arguments will always take precedence over config file settings.



# 'dry_run' is a Nornir-specific config that makes sense from a NornFlow perspective.
# If set to True, NornFlow will invoke Nornir in dry-run mode.

# If set to True, NornFlow will execute Nornir tasks individually in parallel, instead of as grouped tasks within a single parent Nornir task.
parallel_exec: True

# If set to True, attempting to run tasks not tracked in the Task Catalog will be warned, but not raise an error.
