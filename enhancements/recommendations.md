## Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Complete Current Tool
1. Add workflow visualization dashboard
2. Implement advanced secrets management
3. Create scheduling engine
4. Add performance analytics

### Phase 2: Create Companion Tools
1. **InfraFlow**: Terraform/Pulumi automation tool
2. **LabFlow**: ContainerLab/testing environment tool
3. **AppFlow**: Application deployment tool

### Phase 3: AI Agent Integration
1. Develop N8N integration modules
2. Create AI agents for each tool
3. Implement multi-tool orchestration
4. Build unified dashboard for all tools

This approach maintains clear separation of concerns while enabling powerful AI-driven orchestration across the entire automation stack.
