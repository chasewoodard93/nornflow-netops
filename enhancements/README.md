# NornFlow NetOps Enhancements

This directory contains all the enhancements we're adding to NornFlow to make it a comprehensive network automation platform.

## Enhancement Areas

### 1. Network Tasks (`network_tasks/`)
Comprehensive network device interaction tasks:
- **Device Interaction**: Connection management, command execution
- **Configuration**: Template-based configuration, validation, rollback
- **Discovery**: Network topology, device capabilities, LLDP/CDP
- **Compliance**: Policy checking, configuration auditing
- **Backup/Restore**: Configuration backup, restore, versioning

### 2. Workflow Control (`workflow_control/`)
Advanced workflow features:
- Conditional execution (if/when statements)
- Loops and iteration
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Workflow dependencies and orchestration

### 3. Integrations (`integrations/`)
External system integrations:
- NetBox integration
- Git-based configuration management
- Notification systems (Slack, email)
- Database connectivity
- API integrations

### 4. Testing (`testing/`)
Comprehensive testing framework:
- Workflow unit tests
- Integration tests
- Mock device testing
- Validation tools

### 5. User Experience (`user_experience/`)
Enhanced user experience features:
- Workflow visualization
- Interactive workflow builder
- Better debugging tools
- Execution monitoring
- Documentation generation

## Development Guidelines

1. **Follow NornFlow patterns**: Study existing built-in tasks and follow the same patterns
2. **Type annotations**: All functions must have proper type annotations
3. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive docstrings
4. **Testing**: Write tests for all new functionality
5. **Backwards compatibility**: Don't break existing NornFlow functionality

## Getting Started

1. Start with `network_tasks/device_interaction/` - basic device connection tasks
2. Build up to more complex features like configuration management
3. Add workflow control features
4. Integrate with external systems
5. Enhance user experience

Each enhancement area has its own README with specific implementation details.
