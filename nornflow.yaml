# This file serves as a documentation for the NornFlow settings.
# Create your own '<something>.yaml' file in the root of your project, keeping in mind that 
# NornFlow will try to find a settings YAML file through the following order:
# 1. The path specified in the environment variable 'NORNFLOW_SETTINGS'
# 2. The path passed to NornFlowSettings initializer (meaning using the -settings argument)
# 3. The path 'nornflow.yaml' in the root of the project

# List of paths to directories containing the Nornir tasks to be included in NornFlow's task_catalog. It
# defaults to a 'tasks' directory in the root of the project.
# The search is recursive, meaning that all subdirectories will be searched as well. Be careful with this.
